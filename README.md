# Project_1


In order to find the dimensions of the displays across the cafe, we used crosshairs that we can move across the entire screen space to determine dimensions of the display panels. To do this, two white lines that extended across the black screen move up, down, left, and right using the arrow keys. The approximate x and y-coordinates are labeled next to the intersection of the lines. 

Aside from the large contiguous display inside the cafe, the square display panels are labeled from "A" to "O". 

Included is a diagram of areas of the screen space that are mapped to the labeled physical display spaces.
