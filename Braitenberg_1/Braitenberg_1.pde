/*
Based on the work of Valentino Braitenberg, this visual should represent
a number of very simple machines exuding different colors based on their
"moods" and "intentions," with red corresponding to aggression, yellow
corresponding to fear, blue corresponding to love, and green corresponding
to "explorative instinct"

The main display in the Becton Caf√© will show the "devices" themselves moving
around, and the panels outside should change according to their interactions
with one another. Each device (or pair of devices) will have an associated panel

Credit to Yuki de Pourbaix and Julia Shi for their work in helping determine the
borders of the main screens and the hall panels, seen in the github repository
listed above.
